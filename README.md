# General Information
This geospatial data package was used in the Creating a Serviceability Score project analysis. This project aimed to generate service areas of essential services with ArcGIS, and create a "serviceability score" using cutom weighted Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). Calgary-focussed data was used to provide recommendations focussing on building a more sustainable future for the City of Calgary.
# Data Overview
The data provided consists of "Compiled Maps", "Statistics", and "ArcPy Scripts" folders. The data imported from external sources are listed in the reference table provided in the files.

**Compiled Maps** - Consists of Calgary-based maps of the final generated service areas of each essential service and useful transport method, and final generated score maps from the MCDA script.

**Statistics** - Graphs and Tables (.csv files) are provided from analyzing the statistics produced from the MCDA script for serviceability scoring in Calgary.

**ArcPy Scripts** - Two ArcPy python files that automate the proceedures of service area creation from ESRI's ArcGIS Pro Geoprocessing Toolbox, and performing the MCDA, with custom assigned weightings.
